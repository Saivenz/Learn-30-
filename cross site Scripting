This is my first concept in my project learn 30 :)

what is cross site scripting

Cross-site scripting is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. \
XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy

1) stored XSS
2) reflected xss
3) DOM(document object model) based xss

These three are the major types in cross site scripting.

Stored xss:
  stored xss is a our paylaod is stored in target website servers and that is reflected to all users in the website.
reflected Xss:
  reflected xss is a check for input field in the website and inject the payload the payload is reflected only for you .
Dom xss:
dom based s an XSS attack wherein the attack payload is executed as a result of modifying the DOM “environment” in the victim's browser used by the original client side script, so that the client side code runs in an “unexpected” manner.
